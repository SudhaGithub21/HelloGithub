# HelloGithub
"I'm Sudha, who has completed M.Sc. in Computer Science, and my team member's name is Sathya, who is currently pursuing MCA. We worked together to finish this project.We decided to create a travel website focusing on one city, where we elaborate on all the places, adventures, etc., within that city. We split up the pages, with each member designing three pages individually.

I created the Home, Live-On, Blog, and About-Us pages, while my team member developed the Places, What's On, and Kids pages. Together, we connected these pages and pushed our projects to GitHub.

Here's a summary of my contributions to this project:

I mainly used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for this project. I utilized Bootstrap concepts such as grid, carousel, modal, and nav-tabs. Using CSS, I incorporated hover effects, transitions, and transform methods. Additionally, I used a small amount of jQuery and JavaScript for the header."

Technologies and Tools Used:

HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap: Used for structuring the content (HTML), styling (CSS), and enhancing UI components (Bootstrap).
Bootstrap Components: Utilized grid layout for responsive design, carousel for image slideshows, modal for displaying additional content, and nav-tabs for organizing content.
CSS: Implemented hover effects, transitions, and transformations to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.
JavaScript and jQuery: Used minimally, likely for dynamic functionalities such as header behavior.

Thanking for your reading!
